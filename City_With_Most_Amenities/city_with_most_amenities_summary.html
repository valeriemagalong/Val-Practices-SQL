                    <p class="text-secondary">You're given a dataset of searches for properties on Airbnb. For simplicity, let's say that each search result (i.e., each row) represents a unique host. Find the city with the most amenities across all their host's properties. Output the name of the city.</p>

/*
My strategy: My strategy: Since one record in the amenities column
is a comma-separated list of amenities, the total number of amenities
per list needs to be quantified. Using the LENGTH function, get the
total number of characters in the list, and subtract the length of the
list with all commas removed, plus one. (A comma follows a single
amenity; adding one accounts for the last amenity in the list that
isn't followed by a comma.) After deriving the total amenities for
each host, group by city and get the sum of the amenities across host
properties in that city. Wrap this result set in a CTE, then filter
by the city with the max number of amenities.

                    <p class="text-secondary">Assume you're given a table with measurement values obtained from a Google sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Write a query to calculate the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and display the results in two different columns. Refer to the Example Output below for the desired format.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Definition:
                        <ul class="text-secondary">
                            <li>Within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.</li>

/*
My strategy: Use the ROW_NUMBER() window function to number the
measurements for each date ordered by time, and wrap this query
in a CTE.  Use this CTE to group by date, deriving columns for
the sum of the odd rows and the sum of the even rows, respectively.

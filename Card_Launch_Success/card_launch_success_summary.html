                    <p class="text-secondary">Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card. You are asked to estimate how many cards you'll issue in the first month.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Before you can answer this question, you want to first get some perspective on how well new credit card launches typically do in their first month.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Write a query that outputs the name of the credit card, and how many cards were issued in its launch month. The launch month is the earliest record in the monthly_cards_issued table for a given card. Order the results starting from the biggest issued amount.</p>

/*
My strategy: Create a RANK() window function, ranking by issue
year and month for each card, wrapping this query in a CTE.  Then,
filter only the rows that have a rank of 1 for each card to get
the issue amount at the launch month.

My strategy: Activation rate is the number of users that confirmed
divided by total users.  Create a CTE for total users from the
emails table.  Create a CTE for number of confirmed users from the
texts table.  Finally, derive activation rate from these two CTEs.

/*
Alternative strategy: Since the emails table contains all users,
left join emails with texts, filtering texts by only confirmed
activations.  Then, derive activation rate by dividing number of
confirmed users by total users.  Cast one of the numbers in the
derivation as a decimal, since dividing an integer by an integer
results in an integer, and we want to retain the fraction that
results from the division.

The popularity percentage is defined as the total number of friends the user has divided by the total number of users on the platform, then converted into a percentage by multiplying by 100.</p>

                    <p class="text-secondary">The 'user1' and 'user2' column are pairs of friends.</p>

/*
My strategy: Since each row in the facebook_friends table represents
a pair of two users that are friends, it could be the case that a
user in the first column never appears in the second column (and vice-
versa). In order to account for all appearances of a given user in
both columns, derive a single column result set where all values in
the second column are vertically appended to the first column (using
the UNION ALL operator). Wrap this result set in a CTE, then group
by user, deriving their percentage popularity by dividing the count
of their rows in the CTE (i.e. their total friends) by the total
number of users. Assuming that there are no user numbers skipped
(meaning the user number is sequential, like a primary key), the
total number of users can be found by getting the MAX user number.

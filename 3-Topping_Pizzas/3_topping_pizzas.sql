-- Youâ€™re a consultant for a major pizza chain that will be running a promotion where all 3-topping
-- pizzas will be sold for a fixed price, and are trying to understand the costs involved.

-- Given a list of pizza toppings, consider all the possible 3-topping pizzas, and print out the total
-- cost of those 3 toppings. Sort the results with the highest total cost on the top followed by pizza
-- toppings in ascending order.

-- Break ties by listing the ingredients in alphabetical order, starting from the first ingredient,
-- followed by the second and third.

-- My strategy: Use a cross join to create a result table of all possible row combinations from
-- three instances of the pizza_toppings table.  Keep only the rows of this result table where all
-- three toppings are different.  (Comparison operators, e.g. < and >, can be used to prevent
-- duplicate toppings, and to order the toppings based on collation rules / alphabetical order.)
-- Derive a column for the concatenated string name of the 3-topping pizza, and another column
-- for the total cost of the pizza.

SELECT CONCAT(p1.topping_name, ',', p2.topping_name, ',', p3.topping_name) AS pizza,
  (p1.ingredient_cost +  p2.ingredient_cost +  p3.ingredient_cost) AS total_cost
FROM pizza_toppings p1
CROSS JOIN pizza_toppings p2, pizza_toppings p3
WHERE p1.topping_name < p2.topping_name
  AND p2.topping_name < p3.topping_name
ORDER BY total_cost DESC, pizza;

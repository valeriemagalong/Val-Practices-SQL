                    <h4>Question</h4>
                    <p class="text-secondary">You're provided with two tables: the advertiser table contains information about advertisers and their respective payment status, and the daily_pay table contains the current payment information for advertisers, and it only includes advertisers who have made payments.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Write a query to update the payment status of Facebook advertisers based on the information in the daily_pay table. The output should include the user ID and their current payment status, sorted by the user id.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary">The payment status of advertisers can be classified into the following categories:
                        <ul class="text-secondary">
                            <li>NEW: Advertisers who are newly registered and have made their first payment.</li>
                            <li>EXISTING: Advertisers who have made payments in the past and have recently made a current payment.</li>
                            <li>CHURN: Advertisers who have made payments in the past but have not made any recent payment.</li>
                            <li>RESURRECT: Advertisers who have not made a recent payment but may have made a previous payment and have made a payment again recently.</li>
                        </ul>

/*
My strategy: Full outer join the advertiser table with the daily_pay
table, since there can be new advertisers who show up only in the
daily_pay table.  Use COALESCE() to derive a new user_id column that
encompasses all user IDs from both tables.  Use a CASE statement
to derive a column for the new payment status.  If there is a null
in the paid column, then the new status is CHURN.  If the advertiser
does not have a current status, but paid, then the new status is NEW.
If the advertiser paid and has a current status of CHURN, then the
new status is RESURRECT.  If the advertiser paid and has a current
status of NEW or EXISTING, then the new status is EXISTING.

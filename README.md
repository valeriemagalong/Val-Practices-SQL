# 👩🏻‍💻 I practice SQL!

## A collection of challenge questions and their solutions, demonstrating my ongoing journey to elevate my SQL proficiency.

This repository was created and continually updated while I was learning SQL fundamentals at Fullstack Academy DATA (in partnership with NYC Tech Talent Pipeline).  I learned basic SQL data definition language (DDL), with the primary objective of attaining mastery in SQL data query language (DQL) for data retrieval and analysis.  I learned SQL syntax for the following database management systems:

* SQLite
* PostgreSQL
* MySQL

The challenges below chronicle my ongoing SQL practice:

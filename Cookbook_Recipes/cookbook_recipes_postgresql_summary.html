                    <h4>Question</h4>
                    <p class="text-secondary">You are given the table with titles of recipes from a cookbook and their page numbers. You are asked to represent how the recipes will be distributed in the book.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Produce a table consisting of three columns: left_page_number, left_title and right_title. The k-th row (counting from 0), should contain the number and the title of the page with the number <i>2 x k</i> in the first and second columns respectively, and the title of the page with the number <i>2 x k + 1</i> in the third column.</p>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Each page contains at most 1 recipe. If the page does not contain a recipe, the appropriate cell should remain empty (NULL value). Page 0 (the internal side of the front cover) is guaranteed to be empty.</p>

/*
My strategy: The final table has three columns that need to be derived
in some way: left_page_number, left_title, and right_title. The
left_page_number column is just a series of even page numbers. The
left_title column contains titles with an even page_number from the
cookbook_titles table. The right_title column contains titles with an
odd page_number from the cookbook_titles table. Since the left_title
and right_title columns in this final table are mapped to specific
numbers, a CTE must be created with a column for a series of even
numbers (from 0 to the highest page number in the cookbook), and a
column for a series of odd numbers (from 1 to the highest page number).
Left join this CTE with cookbook_titles twice, first joining based on
the column of even numbers from the CTE, then joining based on the
column of odd numbers from the CTE. The left_page_number column is
the series of even pages from the CTE, the left_title column is the
titles mapped from the first join, and the right_title column is the
titles mapped from the second join.
